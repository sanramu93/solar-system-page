            <h2>The Sun</h2>
            <p>
              The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a
              nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by
              nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly
              as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is by far the most important source of energy for life on
              Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000
              miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000
              times that of Earth, and it accounts for about 99.86% of the total
              mass of the Solar System.

            <p>
              Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest
              to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the
              shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god
              Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and
              mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god
              Hermes.
              <br />
              <br />
              Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an
              inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed
              from Earth never exceeds 28Â°.

              Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the
              Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object
              in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and
              can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.
              <br />
              <br />
              Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture
              far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or
              rising in the east a little while before dawn.

            <p>
              Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
              object known to harbour and support life. 29.2% of Earth's surface
              is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8%
              is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other
              salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other
              freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere.
              <br />
              <br />
              Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer
              layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate
              across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior
              remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core
              that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle
              that drives plate tectonics.

              Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest
              planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In
              English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is
              often referred to as the "Red Planet".The latter refers to the
              effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives
              it a reddish appearance (as shown), that is distinctive among the
              astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
              <br />
              <br />
              Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface
              features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the
              valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

              Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the
              Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a
              half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System
              combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the

              <br />
              <br />
              It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after
              the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its
              observed size.

              Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference
              to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek
              mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather
              of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the

              in the Solar System.
              <br />
              <br />
              Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk
              chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas
              giants Jupiter and Saturn.

            <h2>Neptune</h2>
            <p>
              Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the
              Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by
              diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant
              planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive
              than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically
              smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more
              gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
              <br />
              <br />
              The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years. Neptune is not
              visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar
              System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical
              observation.
